# Project devify
Devify was originally a simple script for notifying me when I plugged in my DualShock controller, keyboard, and mouse. Objectively, I believe it's a desirable feature for any desktop environment. The first time it gained traction was on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/14poevz/oc_devify_get_notify_what_device_is_connected/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=1). The project grew, attracting contributors who shaped it with their own ideas and opinions.
