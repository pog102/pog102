# Self-Hosting
Creating a server wasn't quite that hard; I only needed to install some software and enable the daemons. My machine is an old laptop with Arch Linux. Finding the right software took some time, as I was trying out different options. Currently, I'll be hosting my server in my dorm. My university provides me with my own server, but there are caveats, like only providing 5GB of storage. Unfortunately, I'm currently unable to connect to a remote server using SSH.
