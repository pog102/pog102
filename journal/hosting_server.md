Creating a server wasn't that quite hard I only needed to install some software and enable the deamons.My machine is an old laptop with arch linux. Finding the software took some time I was hopping from one software to another. Currently, I'll be hosting my server in my dorm, my university provides me with my own server but there are caveats like only providing a 5GB of storage. Unable to connect to a remote server using ssh.
